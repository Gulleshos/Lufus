                but are easier to care for if planted in soils containing
                high levels of peat moss. These soils retain water and
                fertilizer and provide good aeration if peat moss is mixed
                with perlite. You can find prepackaged soils with these
                ingredients or try doing your own blend. We recommend
                starting with 2 parts peat and 1 part perlite. Repotting is
                necessary when the plant top outgrows the pot and there is

                more it needs a drink. You can also use your finger to feel how 
                dry the first few inches of soil are. Most houseplants would 
                prefer being slightly dry than soaking wet. When it is time to 
                water your plant, slowly poor water onto the soil until water 
                starts escaping from the drainage holes. Containers without 
                drainage should have a layer of lava rocks placed in the
